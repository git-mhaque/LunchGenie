# System Requirements

I want to build an agentic system called "LunchGenie" that can recommend a few places for team lunch based on criteria provided by the user, such as: an Asian theme (Chinese, Indian, Malaysian), rating over 4.7, walking distance, ambient atmosphere, and no red flags from recent customer reviews.

## Technical Requirements

- The system should use an agentic architecture with LLM-based components and tool-calling capabilities.
- It must leverage OpenAI models using my personal API keys.
- The tech stack should be Python-based, using frameworks like LangChain, etc.
- Robust configuration management is needed, with appropriate security considerations.
- The system should support various tools for retrieving restaurant data.

## Next Steps

Create an implementation plan with an initial architecture.
